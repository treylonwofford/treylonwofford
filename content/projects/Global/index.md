# Global Health Outcomes: Exploring the Link Between Population and Life Expectancy

> Despite global economic growth, significant differences in life expectancy persist. This project investigates how a countryâ€™s economic prosperity and population dynamics influence life expectancy, focusing on data from 2000 to 2023. We will analyze measurable trends and identify outliers specifically, the top and bottom 5% of countries so that public health policymakers and international development agencies can target interventions where they are most needed. Our goal is to provide clear, actionable recommendations within the next 12 months to help bridge the global health gap.

**Project Title:**  
*Global Health Outcomes: Bridging the Gap between Wealth and Life Expectancy*

**Overview:**  
This project examines why, despite global economic growth, significant disparities in life expectancy persist across countries. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset from 2000 to 2023 that combines life expectancy and population, we aim to uncover measurable trends and identify outlier nations. Our analysis provides actionable insights to help public health policymakers and international development agencies target interventions where they are most needed.


**Conclusion & Next Steps:**  
- Our findings suggest that while economic growth is an important factor, it is not sufficient on its own to ensure improved health outcomes. Effective healthcare policies and resource allocation tailored to regional needs are crucial.
- The next phase involves refining these insights into specific, actionable recommendations for policymakers, with a goal of implementing changes within the next 12 months.

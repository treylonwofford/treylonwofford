### Hi :wave:

My name is Treylon Wofford, and I'm currently located in [Atlanta, GA](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Atlanta,+GA/) but was born in a small town called [Marshall, TX](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Marshall,+TX/). 

I'm a IAM engineer specialising in Okta and Entra ID, identity-driven solutions. I have designed and implemented comprehensive security frameworks that streamline access management and bolster system integrity. My role involves collaborating closely with cross-functional teams to ensure that identity protocols align with both business objectives and regulatory requirements. I continuously evaluate emerging technologies to enhance security measures and optimize user experience.

Beyond my professional life, I have a strong interest in fitness. I enjoy exploring the Atlanta Beltline, which offers a perfect blend of scenic beauty and an active community, making every workout a refreshing experience. Whether I'm running, cycling, or walking, the Beltline inspires me to push my limits and maintain a balanced, energetic lifestyle.

### IAM Specific Notes

I continuously expand my expertise in the IAM space by engaging in practical, hands-on projects and staying up-to-date with industry trends. I actively participate in learning communities and professional forums, which provide valuable insights and real-world case studies that enhance my technical acumen. By collaborating with fellow engineers and thought leaders, I gain diverse perspectives that challenge and refine my approach to complex identity management challenges. 

I also leverage engineering-specific resources and detailed technical notes to deepen my understanding of emerging protocols and security best practices. This ongoing commitment to learning not only drives my professional growth but also positions me to contribute innovative solutions in the evolving field of IAM.

### Experience

I'm open to IAM, PAM and IGA roles.
